![MIT license](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-blue.svg)

## Description

This application generates a high-quality README file with user input. Users should strive to provide a README.md to describe their project, give installation and usage instructions and to give contact information in case of questions. 

For this particular project, this README file will be at the root level because it  describes this project. An example of a README.md created from this application will be renamed to 'sampleREADME.md' and moved to the assets folder. A video walk-thru of the creation of the sampleREADME file can be found at 'add site link here'. Please see the following screenshots of the Terminal prompts as well as the generated markdown README file (sampleREADME.md).


## Installation
This application requires Node.JS to be installed. The user should then run  ```npm install``` in their terminal to load the Inquirer npm package(version 8.2.4).

## Usage

To begin, run the following command in the terminal to invoke the application.

```node index.js```

Next, the user should answer the  prompts about their project that are displayed in the terminal. After all questions have been answered, a high-quality README.md will be generated and saved into the project's root directory.
